## 🧠 How It Works

- The game is rendered inside an HTML `<canvas>`.
- The snake is an array of cells (x, y positions).
- Movement is handled via arrow keys (`keydown` listener).
- Each frame:
  - The snake moves forward.
  - If the snake hits itself or the wall, the game ends.
  - If it eats an apple, the snake grows and score increases.
